        <p>Hello, My name is Anish Ghimire. I have been playing games and <br>
            learning about computer since childhood.I focused on the hardware <br>
            aspect of computer world up untill high school. It was only after <br>
            I got to college, I was introduced to programming. I instantly <br>
            got a liking to it and I knew I wanted to work with this in the future. <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            I took some programming classes in college and learned some in my <br>
            own free time as well.I already had a base for two programming <br> 
            languages due to the courses I have taken. Currently I am enrolled in <br>
            We Can Code It bootcamp to gainmore knowledge while also <br>
            improving on my current skill sets.
        </p>
